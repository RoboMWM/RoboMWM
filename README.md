Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile, where I host most of my side projects and freelance work. I also contribute to other open source projects from time to time.

While most of my software experience is with **Java**, I've also done a bit of **C#** and often use **bash** scripts for automation.

Devops is something I've been recently interested in. I've been a server administrator of a few game servers (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) since 2011, and I've found that a lot of the skills I developed (espeically automation) are very much applicable to devops. **Pivotal Platform, BOSH, Concourse, and a bit of Kubernetes** are where my experience lies here.

TODO: list some projects here
