## Notable Projects

Currently under construction

### GriefPrevention
- Minecraft server Bukkit plugin, written in Java, uses Bukkit API
- [https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention)
- Players define regions (named claims) in a 3D world and set permissions on who can modify what within their region. This prevents "grief" from occurring within their claim.
- Also includes chat spam filtering.
- One of the largest and most popular projects I maintain.
- Currently working on a rewrite, cleaning and organizing codebase. Adding APIs for addons to augment its featureset.

### Tech Fortress
- Hosting public game servers
  - Use of git and backup software, amongst the other joys of server maintenance
- Fair amount of scripting
  - Mix of powershell and bash scripts
  - Used to provision, maintain, and operate servers
- A lot of devops
  - One server is automatically updated via pipelines
- Community involvement and dispute resolutions
  - Feedback and communication on changes occurs regularly
