I host most of my side projects and freelance work here on GitHub, as well as contributing to other open source projects from time to time.

I'm primarily a devops engineer. Currently working with **OpenShift and Tekton**, and by proxy **Kubernetes**. Previously worked with **VMware Tanzu (formerly Pivotal Platform), BOSH, and Concourse**

While most of my software experience is with **Java**, I've also done a bit of **C#** and often use **bash** scripts for automation.

I've been a server administrator of a few game servers (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) since 2011, and I've found that a lot of the skills I developed (espeically automation) are very much applicable to devops.
